# Security

## Trust boundaries

The controller, GitHub source, private S3 bucket, and MLflow/DagsHub service are trusted
for their documented roles. A RunPod worker is a temporary execution environment and is
not trusted with durable credentials or the only copy of important data.

## Credentials

### Configuration files

`config/infra.example.toml` and `~/.config/wavcse-infra/config.toml` contain only
non-secret configuration. Bootstrap copies the example once with user-only permissions
and refuses to replace an existing file. `.env.example` lists supported variables but
contains no values and is not loaded automatically. `runpod.api_key_parameter` is an
SSM parameter name, not a credential. Real tokens remain in the process environment or
SSM Parameter Store and are never committed.

### AWS

The controller uses an attached EC2 instance profile. Boto3 discovers and refreshes the
temporary role credentials through its standard credential chain; the project does not
accept or install static AWS access keys. `infra doctor` requires Boto3's resolved
credential method to be `iam-role` before making STS or S3 calls, so an accidentally
exported static key is reported rather than used for the diagnostic.

The role should grant only required actions for the configured bucket and `wavcse/`
prefix. Phase 1 diagnostics use STS `GetCallerIdentity` and, when a bucket is configured,
a bounded S3 prefix listing. Later storage phases will require narrowly scoped
`GetObject`, `PutObject`, and `HeadObject` permissions.

For RunPod credential resolution, grant `ssm:GetParameter` only on the configured
parameter ARN:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ssm:GetParameter",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:<region>:<account-id>:parameter/wavcse-infra/runpod/api-key"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `SecureString` uses a customer-managed KMS key, the controller role also needs
`kms:Decrypt` on that key ARN. Do not grant account-wide SSM, KMS, or administrator
access. The application relies on Boto3's normal credential chain; on EC2 the attached
instance profile supplies and refreshes temporary AWS credentials.

### RunPod

Store the persistent controller key as an SSM Parameter Store `SecureString` and put
only its name in `runpod.api_key_parameter`. The resolver calls `GetParameter` with
`WithDecryption=True` once when constructing a RunPod client. A non-empty
`RUNPOD_API_KEY` environment variable takes precedence for local or temporary use. The
key is rejected from TOML and never accepted as a CLI option, avoiding committed secrets
and process-list exposure. Resolved values are not persisted in configuration or local
state. HTTP authorization headers are never rendered. Provider and SSM failures expose
only safe operation/status context; user-facing errors pass through redaction.

Worker management uses REST API v2. Safe GET operations may retry; paid creation is sent once and
is never automatically repeated. A lost create response is reconciled only against the
complete generated infra identity. Start, stop, and destroy accept exact provider IDs;
destroy never resolves names or prefixes. `--yes` skips the human confirmation only and
does not disable cost, capacity, identity, or request validation.

### Local operational state

Created-worker metadata lives in `~/.local/state/wavcse-infra/workers.json`. The
directory is mode `0700`, the JSON file is mode `0600`, and writes use a temporary file
in the same directory followed by `fsync` and atomic replacement. The file may contain
provider IDs, generated names, requested/observed GPU configuration, catalog or observed
price, timestamps, lifecycle/readiness state, provider-reported SSH endpoint
coordinates, bootstrap version, non-secret health timestamps, disk capacity, and GPU
model/driver facts.

It must never contain the RunPod key, authorization headers, SSM values, AWS
credentials, private keys, or complete environment data. RunPod remains authoritative;
the local file is not permission to delete a different or similarly named Pod.

### SSH

Worker access uses the dedicated private key configured by `ssh.private_key`. Commands
refuse a key readable by group/other users; the private key never leaves the controller.
Only its public counterpart is registered in the RunPod account. `startSsh` causes
RunPod to inject account-registered public keys into compatible images. The CLI never
copies controller GitHub credentials, AWS credentials, the RunPod token, `~/.aws`, or
the SSH private key to a worker.

System OpenSSH is invoked with an argv, `shell=False`, an explicit identity, batch/key-
only authentication, bounded connect/command timeouts, and `-F /dev/null` so user SSH
configuration cannot silently redirect the connection. Basic proxied SSH and the
mapped public-IP endpoint are modeled separately; direct is preferred, proxy is the
command-only fallback, and neither is used for artifact transfer.

Host keys use a dedicated `~/.local/state/wavcse-infra/known_hosts` file with mode
`0600`, `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`, and the global known-hosts file disabled for
these worker sessions only. This is deliberate trust on first use: it prevents silent
key changes after the first connection but cannot authenticate the very first endpoint,
so a first-connection network attacker remains a risk. A mismatch fails closed and
requires the operator to inspect the exact Pod endpoint before changing the entry. The
user's normal `~/.ssh/known_hosts` and global SSH configuration are not weakened.

Bootstrap and health scripts contain no credentials. Their small reviewed content is
shell-quoted as one SSH exec argument so proxy execution does not depend on stdin; provider
fields remain separate positional arguments. The worker stores only a non-secret
bootstrap-version marker. Normal workers do not receive OMP, Codex, AGF, controller
authentication stores, or permanent cloud credentials.

### Controller agent tools

`controller/install-agents.sh` uses only official upstream sources. OMP's installer is
downloaded from the exact pinned `can1357/oh-my-pi` Git tag and its resulting release
binary is checked against a reviewed SHA-256 digest. Codex uses OpenAI's official
standalone installer with an explicit release; that installer verifies the selected
release digest. AGF is downloaded from the pinned `subinium/agf` GitHub release and
checked against its reviewed SHA-256 digest. Installer scripts are saved to temporary
files before execution rather than piped directly into a privileged shell.

These tools run as the controller user, not as root. The script may use `apt` only for
missing download primitives, and never weakens filesystem permissions. Tool
installation does not perform authentication. OMP and Codex credentials remain in
their user-owned upstream stores; AGF needs no account and reads existing local agent
session stores. No agent tool or controller authentication state is installed on a
normal GPU worker.

## Presigned URLs

Future S3 transfers will use Signature Version 4 URLs scoped to one object and method.
URLs are bearer credentials until expiry, can generally be reused during that period,
and can expire earlier when the EC2 role session rotates. They must not appear in logs or
state files. Upload flows must avoid accidental replacement and verify checksums and
durability before worker deletion.

## Logging and redaction

Never log:

- authorization headers or API tokens;
- AWS access keys, secret keys, or session tokens;
- private SSH keys;
- OMP or Codex authentication stores and tokens;
- full presigned URLs or query strings;
- SSM `SecureString` values;
- complete environment dumps.

RunPod errors expose the operation, status code, and a sanitized response summary. Debug
mode changes detail, not secret-handling policy.

## Threat assumptions

- A controller compromise can reach all systems authorized to its role and configured
  tokens; controller access and patching are operational security requirements.
- A worker compromise may expose data and short-lived values delivered to that worker.
  Scope and lifetime must therefore be minimized.
- Git commits and dependencies can execute code on workers. Exact commits improve
  reproducibility but do not make untrusted code safe.
- Presigned URLs should be constrained by IAM/bucket policy and protected like bearer
  tokens.

## Repository hygiene

`.env*` files are ignored except for the blank `.env.example`. CI needs no cloud
credentials. Tests use fake tokens and mocked HTTP. Before each phase commit, inspect the
staged diff and scan it for credentials and generated artifacts.
